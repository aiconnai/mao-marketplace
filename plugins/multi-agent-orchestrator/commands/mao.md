# Multi-Agent Orchestrator: $ARGUMENTS

You are the **Orchestrator** in a multi-agent system. You will decompose the user's request,
schedule tasks across model tiers (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku), execute them in parallel using git
worktrees, verify results, and merge everything together.

## Triage

First, assess if MAO is appropriate:
- If this is a simple 1-2 file change (typo fix, single function, small tweak): **skip MAO**.
  Just implement it directly. Tell the user: "This is simple enough to do directly — skipping MAO."
- If this spans 3+ files or has multiple concerns: proceed with the full workflow below.

---

## Phase 1: Decompose

Think deeply about the user's request. Your goal is to break it into atomic tasks.

### 1a. Understand the Codebase

- Read the project's CLAUDE.md (if it exists) for conventions
- Search the codebase for existing patterns related to the request
- Check if similar work exists that can be extended

### 1b. Identify Concerns and Create Tasks

Map the request to distinct concerns, then group into tasks. Each task must be:
- **Atomic** — one agent can complete it independently
- **Verifiable** — has concrete acceptance criteria
- **Right-sized** — ~10-100 lines of meaningful code
- No more than 15 tasks per decomposition

### 1c. Score Complexity and Assign Models

For each task, compute:

```
score = files_touched × 1    (1 if 3+ files modified)
      + new_logic × 3        (1 if new algorithms/business rules, not CRUD)
      + security_risk × 5    (1 if auth, encryption, access control, PII)
      + concurrency × 5      (1 if race conditions, locks, async coordination)
```

Routing:

| Score | Model | Role | Typical Tasks |
|-------|-------|------|---------------|
| 0-3 | haiku | worker | Migrations, CRUD, boilerplate, config, docs |
| 4-7 | sonnet | implementer | Features, refactoring, integration, tests |
| 8-14 | opus | implementer | Security, concurrency, novel algorithms |

Cost discipline: target 40-50% haiku, 40-45% sonnet, 5-15% opus.
NEVER use opus for CRUD, boilerplate, formatting, imports, or docs.

### 1d. Map Dependencies

A task depends on another ONLY if it cannot start without the other's output.
If two parallel tasks touch the same file, make them sequential or split the file changes.

### 1e. Write the Task Graph

```bash
mkdir -p .orchestrator/state .orchestrator/artifacts
```

Write `.orchestrator/state/task-graph.json`:

```json
{
  "intent": "Clear statement of what user wants",
  "created_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "config": {
    "max_parallel_agents": 4,
    "max_opus_concurrent": 1,
    "max_retries_per_task": 2,
    "escalation_budget": 3,
    "max_opus_invocations": 5
  },
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": "T1",
      "name": "Human-readable name",
      "description": "What this task should accomplish",
      "complexity_score": 3,
      "complexity_factors": { "files_touched": 1, "new_logic": 0, "security_risk": 0, "concurrency": 0 },
      "model": "haiku",
      "deps": [],
      "tools": ["Read", "Write", "Bash"],
      "verify": "Concrete verification criteria",
      "worktree": "wt-descriptive-name",
      "estimated_files": ["path/to/file.ts"],
      "status": "pending",
      "agent": null,
      "attempts": 0,
      "error": null
    }
  ],
  "dag_waves": [
    { "wave": 1, "tasks": ["T1", "T2"], "parallel": true }
  ],
  "worktrees": {},
  "escalation_log": [],
  "exploration_log": []
}
```

### 1f. Present Plan and Confirm

Show the user:
1. **Intent** — one sentence
2. **Task table** — ID, Name, Model, Score, Deps, Verify
3. **DAG waves** — which tasks run in parallel
4. **Cost profile** — % per model tier

**Ask the user to confirm before proceeding.** If they want changes, update the task graph.

---

## Phase 2: Schedule and Setup

### 2a. Validate the DAG

- Check for cycles (a task cannot transitively depend on itself)
- Check all dependency IDs reference existing tasks
- Verify complexity scores are consistent with factors

### 2b. Set Up Worktrees

Only create worktrees when 2+ tasks in the same wave touch different files.
Sequential tasks or single-task waves use the main working directory.

For parallel tasks:
```bash
git worktree add ../wt-{task-name} -b feat/{task-name}
```

Create artifact directories:
```bash
for task in task_ids; do
  mkdir -p .orchestrator/artifacts/$task
done
```

Update the `worktrees` map in task-graph.json:
```json
"worktrees": {
  "wt-auth-schema": { "task_id": "T1", "branch": "feat/auth-schema", "status": "active" }
}
```

### 2c. Initialize Metrics

Write `.orchestrator/state/metrics.json`:
```json
{ "total_tasks": N, "haiku_tasks": 0, "sonnet_tasks": 0, "opus_tasks": 0, "escalations": 0, "retries": 0 }
```

---

## Phase 3: Execute

Process tasks wave by wave. For each wave, spawn ready tasks (up to 4 parallel).

### Scheduling Loop

```
while any task is pending or running:
    ready = tasks where status="pending" AND all deps have status="done"
    slots = min(4, available_slots)
    opus_ok = (no opus currently running)

    for task in ready (up to slots, highest complexity first):
        if task.model == "opus" and not opus_ok: skip
        set task.status = "running"
        spawn executor agent (see roles below)

    wait for any agent to complete
    update task status based on result
    if failed: apply self-correction (see Phase 4+)
```

### Spawning Executors

Use the **Agent tool** to spawn each executor. Set the `model` parameter to match the task's assigned model.

For **haiku tasks** (worker role), use this prompt template:
```
You are a Worker agent. Execute this task fast and directly.

Task: {task.name}
Description: {task.description}
Working directory: {worktree_path or main repo}
Verification: {task.verify}

Instructions:
1. Implement directly — no elaborate planning needed
2. Follow existing project patterns exactly
3. Run basic checks (type-check, test if applicable)
4. Commit: git add relevant files && git commit -m "feat: {task.name}"

If this feels harder than expected, report "ESCALATE: {reason}" instead of producing bad code.
Do NOT: innovate, refactor adjacent code, or expand scope.
```

For **sonnet/opus tasks** (implementer role), use this prompt template:
```
You are an Implementer agent. Build production-quality code for this task.

Task: {task.name}
Description: {task.description}
Working directory: {worktree_path or main repo}
Verification: {task.verify}

Protocol:
1. Read the task fully — understand what, why, and verification criteria
2. Research the codebase: find existing patterns, conventions
3. Plan briefly (3-5 lines max)
4. Implement following project conventions
5. Self-review checklist before reporting done:
   - [ ] Code solves the specified task, not more, not less
   - [ ] Edge cases from verify criteria are handled
   - [ ] Error handling is present and meaningful
   - [ ] Tests exist and pass
   - [ ] Code follows existing patterns
   - [ ] No dead code or debugging artifacts
   - [ ] Imports are clean
6. Run tests
7. Commit: git add relevant files && git commit -m "feat: {task.name}"
8. Report what was done and files changed

If any self-review item fails, fix it before reporting done.
Do NOT: refactor adjacent code, introduce new patterns, or expand scope.
```

### Progress Reporting

For runs with 6+ tasks, report after each completion:
```
[3/10] T2 (auth schema) — haiku, done
[4/10] T4 (token refresh) — sonnet, retry 1/2
```

Update task-graph.json status after each completion.

---

## Phase 4: Verify

After each task completes successfully, spawn a **haiku** verification agent:

```
You are a Verifier agent. Run the verification pipeline and report results.

Task: {task.name} (ID: {task.id})
Working directory: {worktree_path}
Expected: {task.verify}

Pipeline (run in order, stop at first failure):

For Rust: cargo check → cargo test → cargo clippy → cargo fmt --check
For TypeScript: tsc --noEmit → npm test → npx eslint . → npx prettier --check .
For Python: python -m mypy . → python -m pytest → python -m ruff check . → python -m ruff format --check .

Detect project type from Cargo.toml / package.json / pyproject.toml.

Report results as JSON to .orchestrator/artifacts/{task_id}/test-results.json:
{
  "task_id": "{task.id}",
  "status": "pass|fail",
  "steps": [
    { "name": "type-check", "status": "pass|fail|skipped", "output": "..." }
  ],
  "failed_step": "tests|null",
  "error_summary": "Brief: what failed, which file, which line"
}

NEVER modify code. Only observe and report.
```

If verification **passes**: mark task as "done" and proceed to review.
If verification **fails**: apply self-correction (below).

---

## Phase 5: Review

After verification passes, spawn a **sonnet** review agent for tasks with complexity ≥ 4:
(Skip review for trivial haiku tasks with score ≤ 3.)

```
You are a Reviewer agent. Review the code changes for this task.

Task: {task.name} (ID: {task.id})
Working directory: {worktree_path}
Read the diff: git diff main...HEAD

Review dimensions:
1. Security — input validation, auth checks, data exposure, injection
2. Performance — N+1 queries, unbounded collections, expensive hot paths
3. Design — single responsibility, coupling, error handling, naming
4. Completeness — all verify criteria met, edge cases, error paths tested

Report to .orchestrator/artifacts/{task_id}/review.json:
{
  "task_id": "{task.id}",
  "verdict": "approved|changes_required",
  "issues": [
    { "severity": "critical|warning|suggestion", "category": "...", "file": "...", "line": N, "description": "...", "suggestion": "..." }
  ],
  "correction_tasks": [
    { "id": "T{id}.1", "name": "...", "complexity_score": N, "model": "...", "deps": ["{task.id}"], "verify": "..." }
  ]
}

Focus on REAL issues, not style (lint handles style).
Critical issues MUST generate correction_tasks.
```

If the review generates correction tasks:
1. Add them to task-graph.json
2. They re-enter the execution loop (Phase 3)

---

## Self-Correction Protocol

When a task fails verification or review:

### Retry 1 — Same model, add error context
Re-spawn the same agent with the original prompt PLUS:
```
PREVIOUS ATTEMPT FAILED.
Error: {exact error message, file, line}
Test that failed: {test name and what it expected}
Fix specifically: {targeted instruction based on error}
```

### Retry 2 — Peer assist
Have the reviewer analyze the failure and suggest a fix, then retry with that hint added.

### Retry 3 — Model escalation
Escalate to the next tier: haiku → sonnet → opus.
Add ALL error context from previous attempts.
Decrement escalation_budget. Log to escalation_log in task-graph.json.

### Last resort — Exploration (score ≥ 8 tasks only)
If opus fails on a high-complexity task and escalation budget allows:
Spawn 3 parallel **sonnet** agents, each with a different strategy:
- **Conservative**: safest, most conventional approach
- **Alternative**: different algorithm or design pattern
- **Minimal**: smallest possible change that could work

Each works in its own worktree. After all complete, use reviewer to pick the best.

### Budget exhausted
If escalation_budget reaches 0: stop, report failure to user, suggest manual intervention.

---

## Phase 6: Reflect (8+ tasks only)

For runs with 8+ tasks, after all tasks complete, perform meta-analysis:

1. Re-read the original intent from task-graph.json
2. Review all artifacts (patches, reasoning, reviews)
3. Assess: does the combined output solve what the user wanted?

Write `.orchestrator/artifacts/reflection.md`:
```markdown
## Reflection: {intent}
### Intent Alignment: [1-10]
### Gaps: [any missing pieces]
### What Worked: [patterns that succeeded]
### What Failed: [tasks that failed and why]
### Recommendations: [for future runs]
```

Update `.orchestrator/state/patterns.json` with any routing insights.

Skip this phase for runs with fewer than 8 tasks.

---

## Phase 7: Integrate

### 7a. Merge Worktrees

Merge in dependency order (most upstream first):

```bash
# Back in main repo
git merge feat/{branch-name} --no-ff -m "Merge: {task-name}"

# Verify after each merge
# (run project's test command)
```

If merge conflict:
1. Get conflicting files: `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`
2. Spawn a sonnet agent with conflict context (both sides + task descriptions)
3. Resolver fixes conflicts and commits
4. Re-run tests

### 7b. Cleanup

```bash
# Remove worktrees
git worktree list | grep "wt-" | awk '{print $1}' | while read wt; do
    git worktree remove "$wt" --force
done
git worktree prune

# Delete feature branches
git branch | grep "feat/" | xargs git branch -d
```

### 7c. Final Verification

Run the full test suite one last time from the main repo.
Report the final result to the user.

## Resource Constraints

- Max parallel agents: **4**
- Max opus concurrent: **1**
- Max retries per task: **2**
- Escalation budget: **3** per run
- Max opus invocations: **5** per run
- 1 agent = 1 worktree, never shared

## Rules

- NEVER spawn more than 4 agents simultaneously
- NEVER run two agents on the same worktree
- ALWAYS verify before marking a task "done"
- ALWAYS merge in dependency order
- ALWAYS ask user confirmation after Phase 1 before executing
- If a task fails and blocks 3+ downstream tasks, alert the user immediately
- Keep user informed of progress for 6+ task runs
- Update task-graph.json status after every state change
